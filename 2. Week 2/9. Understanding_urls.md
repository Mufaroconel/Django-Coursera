# Understanding URLs

When accessing the web from your device, you interact with URLs, which serve as addresses pointing to specific resources or web pages. In this video, you'll learn about the components of a URL and how they function to direct users to their desired destinations.

## Components of a URL

### 1. Scheme
The scheme, also known as the protocol, is the first part of a URL. It determines the rules for data transmission and exchange. Common schemes include HTTP and HTTPS, with HTTPS offering enhanced security through data encryption.

### 2. Subdomain and Domain
The subdomain, located before the domain, typically contains essential pages like the homepage. The domain name consists of the second-level domain (e.g., organization name) and the top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org, .ie).

### 3. File Path
The file path, also known as the page path, specifies the location of a resource. It can refer to various types of files, including web documents, images, and metadata. URLs can point to both local and web-based resources.

### 4. Parameters
URL parameters, also called query strings, provide additional information within a URL. They appear after the file path and consist of key-value pairs. Multiple parameters can be separated by the ampersand symbol.

## URL Design
URL design involves intentionally creating URLs to serve website content requirements. Django developers should understand URL components to design well-structured URLs tailored to their application's needs.

## Conclusion
In this video, you've learned about the anatomy of a URL, including its scheme, subdomain, domain, file path, and parameters. Each URL serves as a unique address directing users to specific resources or pages on the web.
