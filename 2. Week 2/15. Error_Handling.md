# Error handling

Absolutely! Here's the structured text with corresponding Markdown formatting to enhance its presentation:

**Introduction**

* Applications will inevitably have errors despite extensive testing and QA efforts. These may not always stem from coding mistakes.
* Networks can be unreliable, and issues can arise. As a developer, you must implement error handling strategies.

**Error Handling in Django**

* This video introduces error handling with Django.
* You'll explore frequent client and server error responses, working with them in Django's error handling views.

**HTTP Status Codes**

* **100-199:** Informational
* **200-299:** Success
* **300-399:** Redirection
* **400-499:** Client errors (e.g., bad requests, authorization issues)
* **500-599:** Server errors

**Common Client Error Responses**

* **400 Bad Request:**  Incorrect request parameters
* **401 Unauthorized:** User needs to log in
* **403 Forbidden:** Valid request, but the server won't process it (usually due to permissions) 
* **404 Not Found:** Resource couldn't be located

**Common Server Error Responses**

* **5xx Range:** Server failure while processing the request (e.g., application crash, timeout)
* **500 Internal Server Error:** Generic server error

**Django's Error Handling Mechanism**

* Django handles errors by raising exceptions.
* These are managed with error handling views, configurable at the project level.
* Default views exist, but can be customized for a site's style.

## Error handling views

##### views.py(project)

```python
from django.https import HttpResponse

# create your views here

def handler404(request, exception):
    return HttpResponse('404: Page not found')

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse('Little lemon website')
```

**Handler Variables**

* **handler400:** Bad request view
* **handler403:** Permission denied view
* **handler404:** Page not found view
* **handler500:** Server error view

**Customizing Error Views**

* View functions should accept a request argument and return an appropriate response.
* Use HTTP response subclasses for error types (e.g., `HttpResponseNotFound` for 404) 

#### urls.py(project)

```python
handler400 = 'my_project.views.handler400'
handler403 = 'my_project.views.handler403'
handler404 = 'my_Project.views.handler404'
handler500 = 'my_project.views.handler500'
```
