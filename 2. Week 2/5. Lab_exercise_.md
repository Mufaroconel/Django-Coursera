## Assignment: Creating View Functions and Mapping to URLs

**Objective:** Learn how to create view functions that return text and HTML markup using the HTTP response object, and map these functions to URLs to be displayed in a web browser.

1. **Introduction to View Functions:**
   - Understand the purpose of view functions in Django.
   - Recognize the importance of creating view functions for handling HTTP requests and generating responses.
   - Understand the role of the views.py file in defining view functions.

2. **Creating a Hello World View Function:**
   - Open the views.py file in the app directory.
   - Define a view function named `hello` that returns the text "Hello World" using an HTTP response object.
   - Import the `HttpResponse` class from the Django `http` module.
   
3. **Mapping the Hello World Function to a URL:**
   - Open the URLs.py file in the project directory.
   - Add a new path in the URL patterns list to map the `hello` view function to a specific URL, such as `'hello/'`.
   - Import the `views.py` file from the app directory to access the `hello` function.
   
4. **Running the Development Server:**
   - Start the Django development server using the command `python manage.py runserver`.
   - Access the server in a web browser by navigating to the appropriate URL, such as `http://localhost:8000`.
   - Observe the initial "404 Page Not Found" error due to the absence of the mapped URL path.
   
5. **Adding the URL Suffix:**
   - Update the URL path to include the suffix `'hello/'` to match the mapped view function.
   - Reload the web browser to view the rendered "Hello World" text on the webpage.
   
6. **Creating Additional View Functions:**
   - Define a new view function named `homepage` in the views.py file to return the text "Welcome to Little Lemon".
   - Map the `homepage` function to a new URL path in the URLs.py file.
   - Update the browser URL suffix to access the `homepage` view.
   
7. **Integrating Python Code with View Functions:**
   - Implement a third view function that utilizes Python's `datetime` module to display the current year.
   - Import the `datetime` module into the views.py file.
   - Update the URLs.py file to map the new view function to a URL path.
   - Verify the functionality by accessing the corresponding URL in the browser.

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime

   date_joined = datetime.today().year
   ```
   
8. **Adding Styling and HTML Markup:**
   - Define a view function named `menu` to return HTML code with CSS styling for a menu.
   - Incorporate HTML markup and CSS styling within the view function.
   - Map the `menu` function to a URL path in the URLs.py file.
   - Reload the browser to observe the rendered HTML content with styling.
   
9. **Conclusion:**
   - Reflect on the process of creating view functions and mapping them to URLs.
   - Understand the basics of handling HTTP requests and generating responses in Django.
   - Anticipate learning more advanced techniques, such as using templates, in future modules of the course.
