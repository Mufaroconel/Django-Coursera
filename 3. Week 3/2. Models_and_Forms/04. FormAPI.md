# Form API

In this reading item, you’ll explore the important features of the Form class defined in django.forms module.

## HTML Form

Almost every web application collects certain data from the user by presenting them with a form to fill out and submit. A form is a document wherein the user enters their responses at certain labeled placeholders. For example, a form that is used to register on a certain site, or the one used to fill your travel details for booking a ticket, or a job application form.

You can construct a form using HTML’s form tag and its various input elements (such as text, radio, and checkboxes, dropdowns and lists).

```html
<form action="/form/" method="POST"> 
    <label for="Name">Name of Applicant</label> 
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name"> 

    <label for="Address">Address</label> 
    <input type="text" id="add" name="add"> 

    <label for="Post">Post</label> 
    <select id="Post" name="Post"> 
      <option value="Manager">Manager</option> 
      <option value="Cashier">Cashier</option> 
      <option value="Operator">Operator</option> 
    </select> 

    <input type="submit" value="Submit"> 
</form> 
```

HTML has very little validation support for these elements. Hence, you need to use JavaScript functions to validate the data before submitting it to the server.

## Django Form

Django framework includes a Form class, its attributes, and methods in the django.forms module. This class is used as a base for a user-defined form design.

```python
from django import forms 

class ApplicationForm(forms.Form): 
   pass 
```

The attributes of the form are Field class objects. The forms module has a collection of Field types. These fields correspond to the HTML elements they eventually render on the user’s browser. For example, the forms.CharField is translated to HTML’s text input type. Similarly, the ChoiceField is equivalent to SELECT in HTML. The Django form class representing the above Application form would be:

```python
from django import forms    

class ApplicationForm(forms.Form): 
    name = forms.CharField(label='Name of Applicant', max_length=50) 
    address = forms.CharField(label='Address', max_length=100) 
    posts = (('Manager', 'Manager'),('Cashier', 'Cashier'),('Operator', 'Operator')) 
    field = forms.ChoiceField(choices=posts) 
```

By convention, the user-defined form classes are stored in a forms.py file in the app’s package folder. So, if you have a Django app called myapp, the above code is kept in myapp/forms.py.

## Django Form Fields

Out of the many available form field types, some of the most frequently used are as follows:

- CharField: Translates to input type=text HTML form element. If you want to accept a longer multiline text, set its widget property to forms.Textarea
- IntegerField: Similar to a CharField but customized to accept only integer numbers. You can limit the value entered by setting min_value and max_value parameters.
- FloatField: A text input field that validates if the input is a valid float number. Its variant DecimalField accepts a float number of specified decimal places.
- FileField: Presents an input type=file element on the HTML form.
- ImageField: Similar to FileField with added validation to check if the uploaded file is an image. The pillow library must be installed for this field type to be used.
- EmailField: A CharField that can validate if the text entered is a valid email ID.
- ChoiceField: Emulates the HTML’s SELECT element. Populates the drop-down list with a choice parameter whose value should be a sequence of two item tuples.

The instance of the Form class translates to the HTML script of a form. When returned to the browser, the form is rendered.

Let us open the Django shell and check what the form object returns.

```python
>>> from myapp.forms import forms 
>>> f = ApplicationForm() 
>>> print(f)
```
### The following is the output for running the print() function 
```shell
>>> f = ApplicationForm()
>>> print(f)
<tr>
    <th><label for="id_name">Name of Applicant:</label></th>
    <td>
      
      <input type="text" name="name" maxlength="50" required id="id_name">
      
      
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><label for="id_address">Address:</label></th>
    <td>
      
      <input type="text" name="address" maxlength="100" required id="id_address">
      
      
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><label for="id_field">Field:</label></th>
    <td>
      
      <select name="field" id="id_field">
  <option value="Manager">Manager</option>

  <option value="Cashier">Cashier</option>

  <option value="Operator">Operator</option>

</select>
      
      
        
      
    </td>
  </tr>
>>> 
```

You’ll see the following HTML script:

```html
<tr>
    <th><label for="id_name">Name of Applicant:</label></th>
    <td>
        <input type="text" name="name" maxlength="50" required id="id_name">
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th><label for="id_address">Address:</label></th>
```

## Form Template

The form object thus translates to HTML script of form – minus the <form> as well as the <table> tag. To render it on a browser, you have to first write an HTML template and put the form object in jinja2 tag. Let us save the following form.html file in the project’s templates folder.

```html
<html>
<body>
    <form action="/form" action="POST">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <table>
            {{ f }}
        </table>
</body>
<html>
```

Let there be a following view in the app’s views.py file which renders the forms.html template and sends the ApplicationForm object as a context.

```python
from .forms import ApplicationForm 

def index(request): 
    form = ApplicationForm() 

    return render(request, 'form.html', {'form': form}) 
```

Inside the template, the form can be rendered in different ways. Instead of a tabular presentation of the form elements you can use the following variations:

- {{ form.as_table }} will render them as table cells wrapped in <tr> tags. The form is rendered as a table by default.
- {{ form.as_p }} will render them wrapped in <p> tags.
- {{ form.as_ul }} will render them wrapped in <li> tags.
- {{ form.as_div }} will render them wrapped in <div> tags.

## Reading Form Contents

Note that the form’s action attribute is set to "/form" path. So, you’ll provide a form() view mapped to this URL. This function fetches the data submitted by the user. It may be used to add a new row in the database table, or for any other processing.

Inside the view, populate the form object with the POST data and check it is valid. The Form class provides is_valid() method. It runs validation on each field and returns True if all field validations are passed.

```python
from .forms import ApplicationForm    

def index(request):  

   if request.method == 'POST': 
        form = ApplicationForm(request.POST) 
        # check whether it's valid: 
        if form.is_valid(): 
            # process the data  
            # ... 
```

Once the Form instance is validated, you can now access the data in individual field via the cleaned_data attribute. It ensures that the field contains the output in consistent form. In our example, the three values in the three input elements are parsed to Python variables like this:

```python
name = form.cleaned_data['name'] 
add = form.cleaned_data['address'] 
post = form.cleaned_data['posts'] 
```
