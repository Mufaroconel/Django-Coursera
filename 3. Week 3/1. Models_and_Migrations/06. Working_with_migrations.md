# Applying Migrations in Django

## Introduction
In this video, you will learn how to apply migrations in a Django project using the commands `makemigrations` and `migrate`. You will also learn how migrations allow developers to apply version control to the models and explore the generated SQL using the command `sqlmigrate`.

## Project Setup
- Created a project in VS code containing an app called `myapp`.
- Created a class called `Menuitems` in the `models.py` file.
  - This class is equivalent to a table in SQL and contains three attributes: `name`, `course`, and `year` with respective fields.
- Updated the model inside the `settings.py` file to include the `myapp` app in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.

## Making Migrations
- Ran `python manage.py makemigrations`.
  - Django will make migrations for the `myapp` app and create a model called `Menuitems`.
  - A file named `0001_initial.py` will be created.

## Applying Migrations
- Ran `python manage.py migrate`.
  - Django performs migrations, executing the SQL commands generated by `makemigrations`.

## Modifying Models
- Made changes to the model in `models.py`, such as renaming the `course` attribute to `category`.
- Reran the `makemigrations` command to create a new migration file.
- Changed the `name` attribute to `item name` and confirmed the change.

## Viewing Migrations
- Ran `python manage.py showmigrations` to display all performed migrations.
- The X symbol represents applied migrations.

## Reverting Changes
- Reverted back to a previous migration using `python manage.py migrate myapp 0001`.
- Used the `--plan` flag to preview the changes before executing the revert.

## SQL Migration
- Ran `python manage.py sqlmigrate myapp 0003` to view SQL commands for a specific migration.
- Explored the generated SQL, such as `ALTER` statements for renaming columns.

## Conclusion
In this video, you've learned how to apply migrations in a Django project using the commands `makemigrations` and `migrate`. You also learned how migrations apply version control to models and explored the generated SQL using `sqlmigrate`.
