# Understanding the Role of Migrations in Django

Migrations play a significant role in helping carve out the data tables and interactions between a web application and its database. By leveraging models, developers can query data directly from code instead of writing SQL commands. This approach offers the advantage of Django providing a clear history of changes to the codebase.

## Advantages of Migrations

- **History of Changes**: Every model created in the project provides a full history of its creation, addition, and any subsequent changes.
  
- **Incremental Development**: Web application requirements often change in small increments, such as adding attributes to a model or changing attribute names. Migrations facilitate applying and updating schema changes incrementally.

- **Avoid Repetition**: Migrations help prevent duplication of efforts by generating SQL queries from models, aligning with Django's principle of "don't repeat yourself."

## File Structure and Management

- **Migration Files**: Stored in a migration folder, these files are automatically updated in the file system after each migration run.

- **Tracking Migrations**: Django generates migration file names based on the actions performed or timestamps. The `show migrations` command lists migrations under models with auto-incremental prefixes like `0001`. The X symbol indicates the status of applying migrations.

- **Django Migrations Table**: Behind the scenes, Django creates a table called `Django migrations` to track migration details, such as changes, associated apps, and timestamps.

## Migration Contents

- **Python Code**: Migration files are essentially Python code.

- **Dependencies and Operations**: Inside the migrations class, dependencies refer to previous migrations that must be applied before the current one, while operations represent actions performed in the migration.

- **Common Operations**: Operations include `CreateModel` for creating a model and dropping a table, `DeleteModel` for deleting a model and dropping a table, `AddField` for adding a database column, `AlterField` for changing a field definition, and `AddIndex` for creating a database index.

In this video, you learned about the history of changes and how Django applies them to migrations. You also explored how developers can leverage migration history for version control of the model codebase.
