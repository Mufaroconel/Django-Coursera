# Migrations in Django

In the world of web application development, application requirements constantly change, necessitating alterations to the data model of the application. To facilitate this in Django, developers use migrations. 

## Basics of Django and Relational Databases

- Django is designed to work with relational database management systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.
- Data in relational databases is organized in tables.
- Django models represent these tables in the database, defining database fields corresponding to columns in associated tables.

## Understanding Migrations

- Migrations record changes made to models and implement these changes to the database schema.
- Migrations are stored as migration files within each app's Migrations folder.
- They enable developers to make changes to the structure of the database without directly writing SQL queries.

## Example Scenario: Adding a Column

Suppose we want to add a new column called City to the User table:

- Without Django's ORM, a developer would need to execute a SQL alter statement.
- With Django, we only need to add the new attribute to the model.
- Running migration scripts implements these changes, applying them to the database schema.

## Process of Running Migration Scripts

- Django provides CLI commands for applying migrations.
- First, a migration script is created, specifying the models to create against the database.
- After applying the change to the model, running the migration file handles the rest.
- Developers don't need to write SQL as Django manages everything.

## Benefits of Migrations

- Migrations mitigate syncing issues, ensuring consistency between models and the database across team members.
- All changes are kept in version control, providing a history of changes across the application.
- Maintaining database changes from the codebase eases maintenance for the development team.

In summary, migrations in Django streamline the process of making changes to database schemas, offering benefits such as syncing
