# Implementing One-to-Many Relationship with Foreign Keys in Django Models

In Django, foreign keys play a crucial role in establishing relationships between models, facilitating one-to-many relationships. Let's explore an example of using foreign keys to connect two models in Django: MenuCategory and Menu.

## Building the Models

1. **MenuCategory Model**:
   - Add an attribute called `MenuCategoryName`.

2. **Menu Model**:
   - Add attributes for `menu_item`, `name`, `price`, and `category_id`.
   - Use `CharField` for `menu_item` and `name`, and `IntegerField` for `price`.
   - Incorporate a foreign key `category_id` to establish the one-to-many relationship.

<!-- ```python
from django.db import models

class MenuCategory(models.Model):
    MenuCategoryName = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Menu(models.Model):
    menu_item = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.IntegerField()
    category_id = models.ForeignKey(MenuCategory, on_delete=models.PROTECT, default=None)
``` -->
```python
from django.db import models

class MenuCategory(models.Model):
    MenuCategoryName = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Menu(models.Model):
    menu_item = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.IntegerField()
    category_id = models.ForeignKey(MenuCategory, on_delete=models.PROTECT, default=None, related_name="category_name")
```

after defining the models here the next step is to update the admin.py file registering the models

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import MenuCategory
from .models import Menu

# Register your models here
admin.site.register(MenuCategory)
admin.site.register(Menu)
```

ensure that the settings.py file in the app configuration is updated

## Understanding Foreign Key Parameters

- The `category_id` field in the `Menu` model is defined as a foreign key.
- It references the `MenuCategory` model.
- The `on_delete=models.PROTECT` setting ensures that no menu items are removed if a category is deleted from the `MenuCategory` table.
- An additional argument `default=None` is added for handling default values.

## Registering Models and Configuring Settings

- Update the `admin.py` file with necessary imports and register the models.
- Ensure the settings in `settings.py` are updated accordingly.

## Performing Migrations

- Run the server and perform migrations using `python3 manage.py migrate`.
- Check the database to verify the successful migration of both models.

## Exploring the Database

- Open the database and navigate to the `myapp_menu` table.
- Verify the entries in both `MenuCategory` and `Menu` tables.
- Notice the relationship between the `category_id` in the `Menu` table and the respective categories in the `MenuCategory` table.

## Enhancing Readability with `related_name`

- Improve readability by adding `related_name` to the foreign key.
- For example, `related_name='category_name'` can be assigned to `category_id`.
- This allows displaying the category name instead of the category ID in the `Menu` model.

## Conclusion

In this video, you learned how to implement a one-to-many relationship using foreign keys in Django models. By establishing relationships between models, you can effectively organize and manage data in your Django applications.
