**Object Relationship Mapping - ORM**

**What is ORM?**

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It's a technique used in software engineering to convert data between incompatible type systems, such as objects in an object-oriented programming language and database tables in a relational database.

**Key Concepts:**
- ORM maps a class to a table in a relational database, with attributes matching the table's field structure.
- Allows database operations in an object-oriented way, avoiding raw SQL queries.
- Enables quick turnaround time in production environments requiring constant updates.

**Django's ORM:**
- Django's ORM layer maps Python classes (models) to database tables.
- Each model class represents a database table, and each attribute represents a database field.
- Models facilitate CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on database objects.

**QuerySet:**
- Represents a collection of objects retrieved from the database.
- Equivalent to a SELECT query in SQL.
- Provides methods for filtering and querying database objects.

**Example Model Setup:**
1. Define models in `models.py` of a Django app.
2. Apply migrations to create corresponding database tables.
3. Use Django's shell to interact with the models.

**Procedures:**
1. Define the models `Customer` and `Vehicle` in the `models.py` file of your Django app.
2. Apply migrations to create database tables using `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.
3. Open the Django shell using `python manage.py shell`.
4. Create a `Customer` object and save it to the database.
5. Create `Vehicle` objects associated with the `Customer`.
6. Retrieve and manipulate objects using Django's QuerySet methods.
7. Perform CRUD operations such as creating, updating, and deleting objects.

**Example Shell Commands:**
```python
# Create and save a Customer object
>>> from demoapp.models import Customer 
>>> c = Customer(name="Henry")
>>> c.save()

# Create a Vehicle object associated with a Customer
>>> from demoapp.models import Vehicle  
>>> customer = Customer.objects.get(pk=2) 
>>> v = Vehicle(name="Honda", customer=customer)
>>> v.save()

# Fetch objects using QuerySet methods
>>> customers = Customer.objects.all()  
>>> [c.name for c in customers] 

# Filter objects based on criteria
>>> vehicles = Vehicle.objects.filter(name__startswith='H')
```
