## Model Relationships

In this reading, you will explore the different types of relationships between Django models.

### Primary Key

In a relational database, each table representing an entity has one column with a unique value for each row, known as the Primary Key. If the primary key of one table appears as a field in another table while having its own primary key, it's called a Foreign Key.

For example, in a `Products` table, the `ProductID` field is its primary key. In the `Customers` table, if the `ProductID` field refers to the product purchased by the customer, it becomes the foreign key.

The purpose of designing related tables is to avoid data redundancy and ensure data integrity.

### Types of Relationships

There are three types of relationships:

1. **One-to-One**: If one model's primary key is related to only one record in another model, they have a one-to-one relationship.

2. **One-to-Many**: In a one-to-many relationship, one object of a model can be associated with one or more objects of another model.

3. **Many-to-Many**: In a many-to-many relationship, multiple objects of one model can be associated with multiple objects of another model.

### One-to-One Relationship

In a one-to-one relationship, one model's primary key is related to only one record in another model.

Example:

```python
class College(Model): 
    CollegeID = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True) 
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50) 
    strength = models.IntegerField() 
    website = models.URLField()

class Principal(models.Model): 
    CollegeID = models.OneToOneField(College, on_delete=models.CASCADE) 
    Qualification = models.CharField(max_length=50) 
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=50)
```

### One-to-Many Relationship

In a one-to-many relationship, one object of a model can be associated with one or more objects of another model.

Example:

```python
class Subject(models.Model): 
    Subjectcode = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True) 
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30) 
    credits = models.IntegerField()

class Teacher(models.Model): 
    TeacherID = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True) 
    subjectcode = models.ForeignKey(Subject, on_delete=models.CASCADE) 
    Qualification = models.CharField(max_length=50) 
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=50)
```

### Many-to-Many Relationship

In a many-to-many relationship, multiple objects of one model can be associated with multiple objects of another model.

Example:

```python
class Subject(models.Model): 
    Subjectcode = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True) 
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30) 
    credits = models.IntegerField() 
    teacher = models.ManyToManyField(Teacher)

class Teacher(models.Model): 
    TeacherID = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True) 
    Qualification = models.CharField(max_length=50) 
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=50)
```
