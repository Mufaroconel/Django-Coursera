# Understanding HTTP Protocol

## Introduction
The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a core operational protocol of the World Wide Web. It facilitates communication between web browsers and servers hosting websites. HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP, encrypts data for secure transmission.

## Request Format
- HTTP requests consist of:
  - Method
  - Path
  - Version
  - Headers
- Common HTTP methods include:
  - GET
  - POST
  - PUT
  - DELETE

## Response Format
- HTTP responses follow a format similar to requests.
- They may include:
  - Message body
  - Status code
  - Status message
- Status codes indicate the success or failure of the request.
- Status codes are grouped by purpose:
  - Informational (100-199)
  - Success (200-299)
  - Redirection (300-399)
  - Client error (400-499)
  - Server error (500-599)

## Common Status Codes
- Informational (1xx): Provisional responses.
- Success (2xx): Indicate successful request processing.
- Redirection (3xx): Indicates resource movement.
- Client error (4xx): Indicates bad request syntax or content.
- Server error (5xx): Indicates failure on the server.

## HTTPS
- HTTPS encrypts data for secure transmission.
- It ensures that sensitive information, like credit card details, remains private.
- HTTPS usage is indicated by a lock icon in web browsers.

## Summary
- HTTP is essential for web resource transfer.
- HTTPS ensures secure data transmission.
- Requests and responses follow a specific format.
- Status codes indicate the outcome of requests.
