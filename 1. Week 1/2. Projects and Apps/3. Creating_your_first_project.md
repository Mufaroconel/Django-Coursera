# Creating your first project 

# steps in creating a django project

1. Create project directory
2. Create virtual environment
3. Create Django project
4. Run development server


1. Create project directory

+ navigate into a specific directory you want to create the project directory
+ use the following command to create a new directory
```
1 mkdir buildDjango
2 cd buildDjango
```

2. Create virtual environment

```
3 python3 -m venv tutorial-environment
4 source tutorial-environment/bin/activate # activating the virtual environment
```

Once you have activated the virtual environment you are ready to install Django

```
5 pip3 install django #installing django
```

To make sure django has been installed run the following command
```
python3 -m django version
```

now we are ready to create a project

```
django-admin startproject chefsTable
```
beware of the manage.py file command line utility that works like the django-admin command

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
