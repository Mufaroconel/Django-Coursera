## Steps Taken by the Instructor

1. **Introduction:** 
   - The instructor introduces the topic of creating view functions that return text and HTML markup using the HTTP response object.
   
2. **Opening views.py:**
   - The instructor opens the `views.py` file in the app directory.
   - Code for returning "Hello World" text using the HTTP response object is pasted into `views.py`.

   # views.py file
   ```python
   from django.shortcuts import render
   from django.http import HttpResponse

   # create your views here
   def index(request):
      return HttpResponse("Hello World")
   ```

3. **Understanding HTTP Requests and Responses:**
   - The instructor explains the terms "request" and "response" in the context of communicating with the server.
   
4. **Mapping View Functions to URLs:**
   - The instructor explains that creating a view function alone won't do anything because Django doesn't know where to return the content.
   - It's necessary to map the view function to a URL using the `URLs.py` file in the project directory.
   - A new path is added to the `URLs.py` file to map the view function.
   
   # urls.py project
   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import include, path
   from demoapp import views


   urlpatterns = [
      path("admin/", admin.site.urls), # This URL pattern maps any URLs that start with "admin/" to the Django admin site. When a user visits a URL like "example.com/admin/", Django will direct them to the admin interface for managing the site's data
      path('', views.index, name='index'), #the root url which maps to the index view function
      path('', include('demoapp.urls')), # This URL pattern includes the URLs defined in the demoapp.urls module. When a user visits the root URL of the website (e.g., "example.com/"), Django will further process the URL using the URL patterns defined in the demoapp.urls module.

   ]
   ```

5. **Running the Server:**
   - The instructor runs the server using the command `python manage.py runserver`.
   
6. **Testing the Webpage:**
   - The instructor opens the development server in the browser.
   - Initially, a "404 Page Not Found" error is encountered because the path to the view function is not added as a suffix to the URL.
   - After adding the correct suffix, the webpage displays the text "Hello World".

7. **Adding Another View Function:**
   - A new view function called `homepage` is added to `views.py`.
   - Another path is added to `URLs.py` to map the `homepage` function.
   - The suffix in the URL is changed to access the new view function.

8. **Integrating with Python:**
   - A third view function is added to `views.py` to access the `datetime` module in Python.
   - The current year is retrieved and returned to the webpage.
   - Another path is added to `URLs.py` to map the new view function.

9. **Adding HTML Markup:**
   - A new view function called `menu` is added to `views.py`.
   - HTML code with some CSS styling is passed inside an object in Python and returned as an HTTP response.
   - Another path is added to `URLs.py` to map the `menu` function.

10. **Final Recap:**
    - The instructor summarizes the steps taken and the concepts learned in the video.
    - Mentions that while the content returned so far is basic, later in the course, more complete web pages will be returned using templates.
    - Wishes good luck to the viewers in their development journey.
